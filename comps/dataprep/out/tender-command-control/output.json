The block diagram shown in RO of Retail BU applies for CP in I&C. the Consumer Pumps are used for products such as HSD, etc. for large fleets which include State Road Transportation Corporations. Hence managing the Assets is one of the important aspects in I&C.\nRetail Outlet/Consumer Pump: In I&C have the same components such as MPD, ATG and FCC to manage them all as in Retail. The block diagram shown in RO of Retail BU applies for RO in I&C. As it is consumer business, I&C wishes to track Lost Opportunity Sales at Consumer pumps through unexecuted indents of HSD. Unauthorized fuelling at TFM locations, unauthorized decantation, Vehicle Tracking & EM Locking deviations for a robust Supply chain process.\nSupply Location/ Depot: The locations from where the products of I&C are shipped are called the supply locations. For a few products in I&C the supply location can be the Refinery itself. The systems operating under I&C are provided below\n- I. Road Transport Corporations KSRTC\n  - a) Automation System of Retail with dual RFID authorization for fuel dispensing. Configuration of dual tags has been done at the backend to map each vehicle with a driver.\n- b) Currently being done with one RTC and 230+ depots, expected to have 3-5 RTC's in the short term.\n- c) Dashboard for MIS and integration with all Forecourt automation systems and customer systems.\n- II. Road Transport Corporations CTU\n  - a) Ring Based Automation at Fuel inlet of the buses with dual RFID authorization for fuel dispensing.\n  - b) Dashboard for MIS and integration with all Forecourt automation systems and customer systems.\n  - c) Currently being done with one RTC and expected to have 3-5 RTC's in the short term.\n- III. Railways Total Fuel Management (Managed and operated by BPCL) Railways have large tanks (similar to supply location) and fuelling is done using flow meters through fuelling points provided near Railway tracks to fuel the locos.\n  - a) Basic Fuel Automation with Tank ATG, Digital Flowmeters and hand held device to input fuelling data\n  - b) Currently being done at one Railway Depot, expected to do at 5 Railway Depots in six months.\n- IV. Bowsers (Fuel will be in BPCL's account till delivery to customer) Delivery of HSD through I&C managed Bowsers with doorstep delivery for Industrial customers who do not have storage tanks. Expected to have around 30-40 bowsers in the first year subject to the success of the pilot run. Customer is expected to pay for fuel unloaded in their tanks.\nBelow are the interlocks required for Bowsers:\nSome of current systems to be integrated and sample KPIs and associated source systems are (The KPIs listed below are for illustration and not limited to)\n- Sales at Consumer Pumps (Though Automation systems)\n- Unexecuted indents of HSD (Through SAP Systems)\n- Unauthorized fuelling at locations (Through Automation systems , digital flowmeters)\n- Unauthorised decantation ( From ATG)\n- Stock levels in CPs (Through ATG)\n- Vehicle Tracking & EM Locking deviations\n# Based on exceptions envisioned the desired actions / interlocks are defined below:\n2.1.1.3 LPG BU: LPG BU manages domestic and commercial distribution of LPG through standard LPG cylinders or through specific authorized vehicles (to enterprise customers).\n![](_page_22_Figure_2.jpeg)\nPlant Operation deals with filling (or bottling) of the domestic as well as commercial cylinders (SKUs) of various sizes and weights. The delivery process takes care of delivery of all the cylinders to the respective distributors who eventually distributes them to the end consumers.\nEach of the functional area has multiple systems and sub systems to facilitate the entire process. These systems and sub systems are governed by stipulated industry standards and protocols. While safety of employees and consumers is paramount concern, quality of the product needs to be maintained at the best possible way in LPG.\n# Plant Operations (Bottling plant):\nPlant operations has multiple systems for filling LPG in cylinders in safe and secure manner. In order to ensure safety, the every cylinder goes through variety of qualitative and quantitative tests. The block diagram above explains the entire process through which a cylinder goes through. Following automation systems are in place:\n- I. Tare weight scanner: A camera based system checks for tare weight printed on the cylinder and sends feedback to \"Carousel\" (filling machine) to fill in appropriate amount of LPG in cylinder.\n- II. Carousel: For filling LPG in cylinders in appropriate quantity in most efficient time and manner. It is a completely automatic system giving many important parameters.\n- III. Weight Check: Post filling, an automatic weigh scale checks for over or under weigh filling. If weight is found beyond set points, it moved out of conveyer and corrected for weight.\n- IV. Valve leak Detection: This checks for the integrity of spring valve of the cylinder. Frequent verification and calibration of this machine is required.\n- V. O-ring Leak Detection: This checks the leakages due to damages to O-ring. Hence role of this machine is essential and this also goes through frequent verification and calibration.\n- VI. SQC: Statistical Quality Check or SQC is post production quality check where 4% of the entire batch of cylinders is sent for additional quality check for valve, O-ring and weight. As of now it is manual and data is fed in portal.\n#### Typical Interlock implemented at LPG Plants are below:\n# Operability Index for LPG:\n#.

BU primarily undertakes handles distribution of Motor Spirit (MS or Petrol) and High Speed Diesel (HSD). Retail BU has two functional areas i.e. Terminal (Depot) and Retail Outlet. Terminal acts a filling station to tankers (Lorries) which carry MS and HSD to Retail Outlets. Retail Outlets acts as filling station to end consumers. In order to facilitate the functionalities there are many systems and sub systems in each functional area.\n# i) Retail Outlets: Approx. 15000 RO's and 13 Interlocks at each R.O.\nRetail outlets (RO) are the retail points from where the products are sold to end consumers. BPCL offers multiple products to consumers at RO through Multi Product Dispenser (MPD). These MPDs have mechanical system and electronic system. Mechanical system involves pump, valves and nozzles while electronic system consists of flow meter, authentication system, displays and keypads.\nThere are underground storage tanks which store the products to dispense through MPDs connected via underground piping system. Each tank has level monitoring system called as Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG). ATG provides real time data of the remaining stock in underground tanks along with temperature and density.\n![](_page_16_Figure_7.jpeg)\nTo monitor the entire process at RO, there is a managing unit called as Forecourt controller.\n![](_page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)\n#### NeoHOS Architecture\nForecourt Controller (FCC) provides authorization to MPD for dispensing the fuel and transfer the transaction data from MPD to NeoCloud solution hosted on Cloud. Stock levels feeds are provided to FCC from ATG. Stock and consumption data is fed from FCC to the Retail Automation System (RA) through which, dashboards and reports are prepared. Retail Sell Price (RSP) details are fed to the FCC through SAP via NeoCloud solution. Payment details through the Point of Sale are fed into the FCC to complete a typical sales transaction of a customer. Overall system is connected to loyalty server and bank servers for various mode of payments.\nFCC also provides functionality to control all the systems at RO. All the equipment can be controlled as and when necessary through \"Interlocks\". The Interlocks provide facility to ensure adherence to safety and business compliances at an RO.\nAll the FCCs at the Retail Outlets (including Consumer pumps of I&C) are connected to a central system called \"NeoHOS\". NeoHOS is based on Azure platform and can provide connectivity via REST and Web server APIs. NeoHOS API Application developed using NodeJs and it contains around 60+ APIs.\nSome of the typical Interlocks w.r.t. Retail Outlets:\n## ii) Retail Terminal (Depot) 75 Depot:\n![](_page_18_Figure_2.jpeg)\nRetail terminal sometimes known as Depot is filling station of carriers or tanker Lorries (T/L) which carry products to Retail Outlets.\nAt the Terminals all the Lorries use RFID system within an allocated bay area (filling station). Post loading, the lorry is locked and secured using a special equipment called EM Lock. It is then assigned a delivery location and a path. In transit it is constantly monitored using system called as \"Vehicle Tracking System\" or VTS.\nThe systems at the Terminal for storage and dispensing of the product are similar to that of the RO but on larger scale. All these systems at Terminal are governed by a special management system called \"Terminal Automation System\" (TAS).\n## iii) Terminal Automation System (TAS)\nTAS looks after almost all the interlocks/ PLC / SCADA and systems at the Terminal. It takes inputs from Storage Tanks gauges, SAP etc. and also has interlock facility to ensure adherence to compliance and safety. TAS provides access to these interlocks through various communication channels like APIs. Typical Interlock implemented at Terminal are below:\n### Operability Index :\nThe below table illustrates the various weightages of functionality which shall form part of the operability/safety index calculation for any location.\n", "| # | Inter-Lock Name                            | Inter-Lock Mode                                                                                                                |\n|---|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | ATG Communication Failure<br>Interlock     | Nozzles connected to an ATG probe to get locked in<br>case that ATG probe fails                                                |\n| 2 | Auto RSP Interlock                         | Nozzles to get locked in case Auto RSP is not changed<br>at 6 am                                                               |\n| 3 | Auto RSP Mismatch Interlock                | Nozzles to get locked in case there's mismatch in SAP<br>RSP and running Auto RSP                                              |\n| 4 | NPND (No print No Dispensing)<br>Interlock | Nozzles can operate only in NPND mode                                                                                          |\n| 5 | Testing Interlock                          | Nozzles to get locked if Test quantity exceeds the<br>parameter value or if testing is not done in 24 hours                    |\n| 6 | TT (Bulk Receipt) Decantation<br>Interlock | Nozzles to get locked during decantation w.r.t. signal from<br>ATG (to address simultaneous decantation, sales from a<br>tank) |\n| 7 | Tank Level Low Interlock                   | Nozzles to get locked if Tank stock is below threshold                                                                         |\n", "| #  | Inter-Lock Name                | Inter-Lock Mode                                                                                                                                           |\n|----|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 8  | Water Level High Interlock     | Nozzles to get locked if Water level is more than threshold<br>(EBMS \u2013 Nil water)                                                                         |\n| 9  | Preset Vs Actual Interlock     | Nozzles to get locked if number of pre-set mismatch<br>transactions in a certain period is more than threshold.                                           |\n| 10 | Density Interlock              | Nozzles to get locked in case of density variance                                                                                                         |\n| 11 | Network Connectivity exception | Nozzles to get locked in absence of Network after a<br>threshold time; In case the outlet is offline parameters to<br>be captured to take suitable action |\n| 12 | Nozzle/Bay interlock           | Nozzles to get locked if BPCL desires so                                                                                                                  |\n| 13 | Unauthorised product receipt   | Tracking<br>with<br>respect<br>to<br>SAP<br>invoice and<br>ATG<br>reading/Geo fence of tank lorry                                                         |\n", "| # | SUPERCRITICAL INTERLOCKS                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |\n|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n| 1 | Tank overfill prevention- closure of tank inlet Remote Operated Shut Off Valve (ROSOV)<br>upon activation of high level switch                                                                                   |  |\n| 2 | Plant ESD -

This poses a major problem in communicating the daily changes of Petrol/ Diesel prices to the ROs automatically from the central server.\nTotal number of locations will be 900 RO with single interlock.\nNozzle flow and usage: Ensuring Q&Q to the customer is utmost focus for BPCL. In order to measure the discrepancy in fuel delivery to customer vehicle tank, BPCL is in the process of implementing the IOT based device which shall sense the flow rate in MPD hose, nozzle and low pressure in STP etc and provide the exceptions. Interlock on all such exceptions are to be integrated in C&C for interlock & monitoring purpose\nVTS System (Bi Directional): Two different VTS have been implemented in LPG and retail BU respectively which need to be integrated with C&C for exception purposes mentioned above. These VTS are already managing approximately 15000 T/L across India. The real time information of T/L should be viewed in C&C platform if required.\nTerminal Automation System (Bi Directional): TAS has to be integrated with C&C as part of implementation within one year where all interlock with be bidirectional controlled as per SOP defined.\n> Total number of 75 locations with various type of automation system ( Honeywell, Yokogava etc)\nLPG Plant Automation System (Bi Directional): All 55 plant's automation systems including Kosan and other systems are to be integrated as and when available during the contract period.\nBROMA System (Uni Directional): Bharat Retail Outlet Maintenance Application (BROMA) is being used for complaint raising, monitoring, and updating their status, calculation of LD based on the applicable SLA etc. The application is developed in-house in BPCL and has SAP platform at the\nbackend. It is required to integrate BROMA with C&C for generating exceptions and taking action based on SOP within one year.\nSAP System, Customer Engagement Portal (CEP) : BPCL has ERP system implemented across the BU.

Bidder shall be responsible for providing appropriate web based online SLA measurement and monitoring tools and BPCL may also appoint an independent technical auditor or third party for monitoring the service levels. Bidder shall be expected to take immediate corrective action for any breach in SLA. In case issues are not rectified to the complete satisfaction of BPCL, within a reasonable period of time defined in this RFQ, then BPCL shall have the right to take appropriate penalizing actions, or terminate the Contract.\n- d) For the purpose of the SLA, definitions and terms as specified in the document along with the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n  - (i) \"Total Time\" Total number of hours in consideration for evaluation of SLA performance.\n  - (ii) \"Downtime\" Time period for which the specified services/ components /system /equipment become unavailable (due to any reason whatsoever) for business processing to the end user in the concerned period, being considered for evaluation of SLA, which shall exclude downtime owing to Force Majeure and reasons beyond control of the Bidder.\nNote 1: Any downtime for maintenance shall be with prior written intimation & confirmation of BPCL.\nNote 2: Please note that continuous downtime of every 2 hours (from 7am to 12 midnight) would raise the severity by one level. e.g. the severity level will raise from 0 to 1 Note 3: Please note that continuous downtime of every 4 hours (from midnight to 7am) would\n- raise the severity by one level. e.g. the severity level will raise from 0 to 1 (iii) \"Scheduled Maintenance Time\" \u2013 Time period for which the specified services/components/system with specified technical and service standards are not available due to scheduled maintenance activity. The Bidder shall take at least 15 days prior approval from the BPCL for any such activity. The scheduled maintenance shall be carried out during non-peak hours and shall not exceed more than four (4) hours and not more than four (4) times in a year.\n- (iv) \"Uptime\" Time period for which the specified services are available in the period being considered for evaluation of SLA.\nUptime (%) = [1- {(Total Downtime - Scheduled Maintenance Time) / (Total Time - Scheduled Maintenance Time)}]\\*100.\n- (v) Penalties shall be applied for each criteria individually and then added together for the total penalty for a particular quarter.\n- (vi) \"Incident\" Any event/abnormalities in the service/system being provided that may lead to disruption in regular/normal operations and services to the end user.\n- (vii) \"Response Time\" Time elapsed from the moment an incident is reported to the Helpdesk either manually or automatically through the system to the time when a resource is assigned for the resolution of the same.\n- (viii) \"Resolution Time\" Time elapsed from the moment incident is reported to the Helpdesk either manually or automatically through system, to the time by which the incident is resolved completely and services as per the Contract are restored.\n- 3) Service Level and Penalties\nIndicative severity definition has been provided below:\nService Level \u2013 Critical: Environment is down or major malfunction resulting in an inoperative condition or disrupts critical business functions and requires immediate attention. A significant number of end users (includes business users) are unable to reasonably perform their normal activities as essential functions and critical programs are either not working or are not available.\nService Level \u2013 Medium: Loss of performance resulting in users (includes public users) being unable to perform their normal activities as essential functions and critical programs are partially available or severely restricted. Inconvenient workaround or no workaround exists. The environment is usable but severely limited.\nService Level \u2013 Low: Moderate loss of performance resulting in multiple users (includes public users) impacted in their normal functions.\n- a. Performance Penalty for not meeting a measurement parameter for any two months in consecutive quarters shall result in twice the penalty percentage of that respective measurement parameter in the third quarter for all the three months\n- b. Maximum Penalty applicable for any quarter shall not exceed 10% of the 'applicable fees' for the respective quarter.\n- c. Three consecutive quarterly deductions of 10 % of the applicable fee on account of any reasons shall be deemed to be an event of default and termination as per RFQ.\n- d. The payment to the Bidder shall be on Quarterly basis and the penalty shall be calculated on Quarterly basis as per the SLAs stated in the RFP.\n- 4) Measurements and Targets: The SLA metrics provided specifies performance parameters as baseline performance, lower performance and breach. All SLA calculations will be done on quarterly basis. The SLA also specifies the liquidated damages for lower performance and breach conditions.\n- a. The SLA parameters shall be measured as per the individual SLA parameter requirements and measurement methods through the system generated reports to be provided by the Bidder and approved and audited by the BPCL or its appointed Consultant or authorized representative for accuracy and reliability.\n- b. BPCL shall also have the right to conduct, either itself or through any other agency as it may deem fit, an audit / revision of the SLA parameters. The SLAs defined, shall be reviewed by the BPCL on an annual basis after consulting the Bidder and other experts. All the changes would be made by the BPCL after consultation with the Bidder and might include some corrections to reduce undue relaxation in Service levels or some corrections to avoid unrealistic position of liquidated damages, which are noticed after project has gone live.\n#### Implementation, Operation & Maintenance Phase related performance levels :\nNote:\n- 5) Application/Solution availability will be dependent on BPCL's cloud services availability, Bidder is not responsible for application non availability due to unavailability of BPCL cloud. Reporting Procedure: Bidder representative shall prepare and distribute Service level performance reports in a mutually agreed format by the 5th working day of subsequent month. The reports shall include \"actual versus target\" Service Level Performance, a variance analysis and discussion of appropriate issues or significant events. Performance reports shall be distributed to BPCL management personnel as directed by BPCL. Also, Bidder may be required to get the Service Level performance report audited by a third-party Auditor appointed by the BPCL.\n- 6) Reports of incidents reported, device failure etc. has to be submitted by Bidder on weekly basis.\n", "| #                         | Service Level<br>Definition<br>Target<br>occurrence)           |
